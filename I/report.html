        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <article id="project-scope">
            <h3>1.1 Project Scope</h3>
            <p>The goals of the project is to support developers in collecting, interrelating and finding resources of
                interest, i.e. specialized websites, tutorials, multimedia presentations, source code, software projects
                etc., targeting creative programming: creative coding depending on the purpose, the programming
                languages (e.g., JavaScript, WebGL, WebAssembly), the desired result (2D illustration, 3D virtual world,
                animation, sound content), the manner of interaction (classical, tactile, vocal) and others.</p>
            <p>Based on the purpose ("I want to create landscapes using fractals", "I need a polyphonic generator")
                and/or the user's preferences (e.g., "only JavaScript/TypeScript implementations"), the system will
                recommend existing software solutions (frameworks, libraries, components etc.) necessary to create an
                artifact.
            </p>
            <p>The platform, therefore, bridges the gap between complex programming concepts and tangible creative
                outputs. By facilitating access to relevant resources based on specific project needs or user
                preferences, it
                encourages experimentation, creativity, learning, and, ultimately, the development of unique digital
                artifacts.

        <article id="product-perspective">
            <h3>2.1 Product Perspective</h3>
            <p>This platform is a pioneering, standalone product designed to significantly enhance the accessibility and
                usability of resources for creative programming. It serves as an intermediary between developers and a
                vast array of educational and practical resources, utilizing cutting-edge natural language processing to
                offer tailored recommendations. The system's uniqueness lies in its ability to interconnect with both
                local databases and external APIs like OpenAI, providing a seamless integration for users seeking to
                advance their programming skills in creative and innovative ways.
